card images can be found on the discord, cant get them to upload to github for some reason


Use this how you like.

I personally sell the packs at a "card shop", and have it set so you craft specific groups of cards into items needed for other activities.
This has been in use in my server for months "Dreamscape RP". https://discord.gg/z5HaTBvuND

Anything commented out in the server.lua is templates for non rarity bigger packs, if you want to take a shot at making a bigger pack with rarity go for it.
